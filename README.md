# The-Muddy-Children-Problem
My programmatic solution to the muddy children problem.

I have also attached a incomplete one if you would like to try.

## Key
`m`: muddy
`c`: clean

## The problem
**Premise:**
* There are *x* children standing in a group.
* Some have mud on their foreheads.
* Each child can see othersâ€™ foreheads, but not their own.

**Rules:**
* No communication is allowed except answering a repeated question.
* A parent announces: "At least one of you has mud on your forehead."
* In each round, the parent asks: "Do you know if you are muddy?"
* All children answer **simultaneously** each round.
* If a child knows they are muddy, they must say **"Yes"** and step forward.
* If not, they must stay **silent**.
* The process repeats until all muddy children have stepped forward.
